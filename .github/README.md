# [Oppia-Android](https://www.oppia.org)

Oppia-Android is a mobile application version of [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org). It is an Android application that enables anyone to easily learn through interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

Moreover, users can create their profile, practice a set of skills, play with explorations, review previously finished skills and also track their progress.

Oppia-Android app is written in Kotlin and Python, and is built on top of Google App Engine.
